# Changelog

All notable changes to Clave are documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versions use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Remote clients can organize the sidebar** — the iPad app can now reorder tabs and groups, move a session into or out of a group, create a group from a session, ungroup, recolour, rename, and undo the last change, all over the existing control plane. Six commands (`moveItems`, `ungroupSessions`, `deleteGroup`, `setGroupColor`, `undoSidebar`, and `sessionIds` on `createGroup`) map straight onto the store actions the sidebar's own drag and drop already calls, and the snapshot carries the sidebar's `displayOrder` so a client renders the order it is reordering. Advertised as the `organize` capability, so older clients hide it rather than fail on it.
- **Deleting a group from a remote client** ends its sessions and its quick-launch terminals, which the sidebar's own Delete has always done for the tabs and now does for the terminals too (their PTYs used to be dropped from the store while still running).

## [1.64.0] — 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Server buttons in the toolbar** — a quick-launch terminal that declares a `serverUrl` in its `.clave` file becomes a service button: one click means "make this server exist and take me to it". If the server is already up (even started by hand, or still running from before a Clave restart) the browser opens instantly with no respawn; if it is down, the command is rerun in its terminal and the browser opens the moment the URL appears — following the server if it comes up on a different port. The button shows a live status dot (up / starting / down), and right-click or ⌥-click opens just the terminal popover.

### Changed
- **Workspace auto-discovery is faster and looks deeper** — the scan now stops descending into a project once its workspace file is found (a workspace defines its whole repo), which makes the walk cheap enough to search six levels deep instead of four, and directory reads no longer block the app.

### Fixed
- **Discovery works when the workspace root has its own `.clave/workspaces/`** — a root-level workspace definition used to stop the entire scan at depth zero, so no projects were found.
- **Toolbar terminals reattach and sync reliably** — a persistent terminal whose process died while its popover was closed no longer leaves a stale reattach reference, and editing a pinned group no longer silently drops `cwd`, `autoLaunchLocalhost`, or `persistent` from the backing `.clave` file.

## [1.63.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Markdown pages are directly editable** — page mode is now a Notion-style writing surface: click anywhere and type. Typing `# `, `- `, `> ` or ` ``` ` converts blocks live, checkboxes toggle with a click, tables edit cell by cell, and code blocks edit inline with syntax highlighting. Edits save back as clean markdown (⌘S or the Save button, exactly like source mode), frontmatter is preserved untouched, and Preview keeps its read-only render. Files the editor can't represent fall back to the read-only page with a hint to use Source.

### Fixed
- **No stale content when switching files** — the file preview and file tabs now clear the previous file's content immediately when switching to another file, instead of briefly showing the old file while the new one loads.

## [1.62.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Markdown opens as a page** — markdown files now render as a document-style page by default: a centered reading column with generous margins and a real typographic scale, with YAML frontmatter hidden and its title shown as the document title. The compact preview and the raw source editor remain one click away via a new Page / Preview / Source switcher, in both file tabs and the floating file preview.

### Changed
- **One header row for file tabs** — the file tab header now fits everything in a single row: file name, full path, the view switcher, save state, and actions. Previously these were spread across three stacked rows.

## [1.61.2] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Edits to `.clave` workspace files are picked up reliably** — the file watcher went silent after the first change when an editor or agent saved the file by replacing it (the common case), so later edits never reached the app until a restart. Clave now watches the containing folder instead, which survives those saves.
- **Adding or removing a group in a `.clave` file updates your pinned groups live** — a group added to the file now appears as a pin without restarting Clave, and pins whose group was removed from the file are dropped (running sessions are never touched). Previously only existing groups were refreshed.
- **Unloading one group of a multi-group workspace file no longer stops updates for its siblings** — removing a single pin used to detach the file watcher shared by every group in that file.

## [1.61.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **Renamed sessions keep their name after a crash or reboot** — a tab you renamed used to come back labelled with its folder name if Clave went down without quitting cleanly. Names (yours and the auto-generated ones) are now saved to disk the moment they change and restored with the session.

## [1.61.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Agents can show you files and notify you** — two new MCP tools for the agents running in your tabs. `clave_open_file` lets an agent open a file (a plan, report, or document it produced) as a regular file tab so you can read or edit it right away; opening the same file twice just refocuses the existing tab. `clave_notify` lets an agent fire a native macOS notification when long-running work finishes in a tab you are not looking at — clicking the notification jumps you to that tab, and nothing is shown if you are already there.

## [1.60.2] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **"Give us feedback" now sits directly above your profile** — the collapsed feedback link moved into the sidebar footer, so it follows the same spacing as every other row there instead of hovering above it.

## [1.60.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **The "Give us feedback" line no longer floats above your profile** — once the feedback prompt is collapsed, the remaining one-line link now sits flush against the sidebar footer instead of leaving an odd gap below it.

## [1.60.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Talk to us** — Clave has no accounts, so we have no idea who uses it or how. A prompt in the sidebar now invites you to book a 30 minute call or leave your email, so we can learn what to build next. It collapses to a single "Give us feedback" line that stays available whenever you want to reach us, and never expands again. Nothing you send is linked to the anonymous usage ping: we still cannot tell which install is yours.

### Fixed
- **Activating your first workspace no longer leaves stale pins behind** — if you already had pinned groups before adding a workspace, Clave snapshots them into an "Init" workspace. That snapshot is now correctly unloaded when you activate another workspace, instead of leaving the old pins on top of the new ones with no way to unload them. The Init workspace also stops disappearing from Settings → Workspaces right after it is created.

## [1.59.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Mission Control overlay** — when you open macOS Mission Control or App Exposé, Clave now covers its window with a blurred overlay bearing a large Clave mark, so you can spot it instantly among all the thumbnails. It needs no Accessibility or Screen Recording permission, and you can turn it off under Settings → Appearance.
- **Primed sessions in `.clave` workspaces** — a session in a `.clave` file can now carry a `prompt` that Clave types and submits to the agent automatically the moment the session launches, plus a `rootSession` flag that starts the session at the workspace root while still targeting the project folder. Prompts understand `@root_path`, `@project_path`, and `@project_abs` tokens that expand to the right paths at launch, and duplicating a primed session replays it as-is.

## [1.58.0] — 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **Antigravity CLI replaces Gemini CLI** — Google retired the standalone Gemini CLI on June 18, 2026 and folded it into the new **Antigravity CLI**. Clave's **Cmd+I** shortcut, the **New session** menu, and the **Usage** panel now launch and show **Antigravity CLI** (the `agy` binary) with its brand mark instead of Gemini. Your existing Gemini sessions, pinned groups, and `.clave` files keep working and reopen as Antigravity automatically.

## [1.57.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Manage plugins from Extensions** — the Extensions view can now install and uninstall plugins, enable or disable them, and add or remove marketplaces directly, instead of being read-only. Open a marketplace to **Install** any plugin it offers (or **Remove** the marketplace), open an installed plugin to **Enable / Disable** or **Uninstall** it, and use **Add marketplace** to register a new one from a GitHub repo, git URL, or local path. Disabled plugins are flagged so you can tell them apart at a glance. Changes apply the next time you start a Claude session.

## [1.56.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- File previews no longer get stuck — opening a longer file (`.json`, `.sh`, `.clave`, and other code files) from the file panel is scrollable again instead of clipping the content below the fold.
- Opening a template from the template picker now always spawns a fresh group. Previously, deleting a template-spawned session from the sidebar could leave the template stuck — clicking it again only flashed its colour dot and never reopened it.

## [1.56.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Trusted workspace folders** — adding a workspace folder now trusts it as a root, so every `.clave` file discovered inside it opens without re-prompting. No more repeated warning dialogs when you run many workspaces or when Clave (or a `git pull`) rewrites a `.clave` file. A new **Trusted workspace folders** card in Settings lists your trusted roots and lets you revoke any of them, and existing workspaces are trusted automatically on upgrade. Files opened from outside any trusted folder still ask for confirmation as before.

### Changed
- The group terminal folder picker now opens at the group's root folder instead of your home directory.

## [1.55.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Extensions** — a new view (under New Session in the sidebar) that shows everything installed for a Claude Code profile. Browse your **Marketplaces** as cards, drill into one to see its **Plugins**, then open a plugin to see its **Skills, Agents, Commands, and MCP servers**. A separate **MCP Servers** tab lists every server across all sources, and a **Standalone** card surfaces skills and commands that don't belong to any plugin. With multiple Claude accounts, a profile dropdown scopes the whole view to that account.

### Removed
- **Task Queue** — the Queue view for staging prompts and running them later as Claude sessions has been removed.

## [1.54.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Anonymous daily usage ping** — Clave now sends one anonymous ping a day (a random ID, the app version, and your platform — nothing else) so we know how many people use it. A first-run notice explains it with a one-click "Turn off", and a new **Privacy** section in Settings → General lets you toggle the ping at any time. The README's "Privacy & network" section documents the exact payload.

## [1.53.0] — 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **Settings is now a full page with its own sidebar.** Opening Settings swaps the session list for a dedicated navigation — General, Appearance, and Usage — with a back button to return to your sessions. Usage moved inside Settings, and options are presented in grouped cards with slim, compact controls for a cleaner, denser look.
- The sidebar footer is a slimmer single row: clicking it (or its gear icon) opens Settings directly instead of showing a popup menu, and the separator line above it is gone.

## [1.52.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Agents can now drive Clave through an in-app MCP server.** A Claude session can open new agent tabs (with an initial prompt) and launch your pinned workspace groups directly, so a coordinating agent can set up and hand off work across tabs without you wiring it up by hand.
- **Private secret injection** — an agent can ask for a secret (an API key, a token) without it ever appearing in the chat. The request shows up in the toolbar, you review the exact action and paste the value into a masked field, and Clave injects it scoped to that one action. The agent never sees the secret.

### Security
- Hardened remote connections: OpenClaw connections can now use encrypted transport, the OpenClaw access token is stored encrypted on disk instead of in plain text, and SSH connections now verify the server's identity (pinned on first connect) to guard against machine-in-the-middle attacks.
- Workspace (`.clave`) files that try to run commands automatically or start an agent with permission prompts disabled now ask for your confirmation before doing so — unless you created or already trusted that file — so opening a workspace shared by someone else can't silently run code.
- Links opened from terminal output and previews are now restricted to web and email addresses, closing a trick where a link could be made to display one destination but open another.

### Changed
- Smoother, snappier session list and agent chat: the sidebar and streaming responses do far less redundant work, so they stay responsive with many sessions open and during long agent replies.
- The toolbar's open-URL tags no longer show a scrollbar when scrolled horizontally on a trackpad.

## [1.51.3] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- The Files panel now shows files that were added while a folder was collapsed. After the recent change to watch only the folders you can see, a folder you had expanded and then collapsed kept showing its old contents — anything added inside it while it was collapsed (for example by a long-running agent) didn't appear when you expanded it again. Expanding a folder now re-reads it from disk, so its contents are always up to date.

## [1.51.2] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- You can now select and copy text from a terminal's scrollback. Previously, scrolling up and then pressing the mouse to highlight text snapped the view straight back to the bottom, so the selection never started. Pressing no longer jumps to the bottom — drag to highlight, and releasing copies the selection to your clipboard. The fix also applies to sessions that were already running, without needing to restart them.

## [1.51.1] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- In folders with many repositories, you can now control when the Git panel pauses live updates. A new **Git** section in Settings lets you raise the "pause above N repos" threshold or turn pausing off entirely so live updates always run.

### Fixed
- The Git panel no longer feels frozen in large folders where live updates are paused. Committing in a subfolder used to leave the panel unchanged until you manually refreshed, which made it look like nothing had happened. The panel now refreshes itself automatically when an agent finishes a turn and when the window regains focus, and the paused banner shows the last update time plus a spinner while refreshing — so you can always tell it's current.

## [1.51.0] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- The Files panel no longer spikes CPU when opened on a very large folder (e.g. your home directory or the filesystem root). It previously watched the entire folder tree recursively for changes — on a huge tree that means reacting to every file change anywhere on disk. It now watches only the directories you can actually see (the current folder plus the ones you've expanded), adding and removing watches as you expand and collapse, so the cost scales with what's on screen rather than what's on disk.
- The Git panel no longer spikes CPU when opened on a very large folder (e.g. your home directory or the filesystem root). Repo discovery is now bounded and cached: it skips system and dependency directories, finds repos breadth-first so shallow repos surface quickly, stops cleanly on huge trees instead of crawling everything, and reuses earlier scans — opening a subfolder of an already-scanned folder costs nothing, and scanning a parent reuses what it already knows about its children. Status and fetch updates run with a capped number of parallel git calls, and in folders with many repos (50+) live polling is paused in favor of a manual Refresh, shown in a small banner. The Git panel only does this work while it's open.
- Sessions now come back after a reboot, not just after quitting and reopening. Persistent (tmux) sessions live in a background process that a shutdown or restart kills, so previously they were lost on the next launch. Clave now keeps each session's details on disk and, when it finds the tmux process gone, re-opens the tabs in their original folders automatically. Claude Code sessions also resume their previous conversation.

## [1.50.1] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Groups now survive quitting and reopening Clave. Previously, when persistent (tmux) sessions reattached on launch, the sessions came back but their groups were lost — a group's sessions and attached terminals reappeared loose in the sidebar. Groups (with their names, colors, terminals, and ordering) are now saved to disk and restored around the reattached sessions, surviving a crash or force-quit as well as a normal quit.

## [1.50.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Claude Code accounts** — run sessions under different Claude accounts side by side. Define named accounts in Settings → Claude Code accounts, each pointing at its own config directory, and once you have more than one a picker appears when you start a Claude session (hover Claude Code / Claude Agents in the New Session menu). The keyboard shortcuts use your selected default account, and each session's header shows which account it's running under. New accounts start signed out — the first session on one runs Claude's normal login. With a single account, nothing changes.

## [1.49.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Persistent sessions (tmux)** — sessions now run inside a tmux session, so your agents keep running after you quit Clave, survive crashes, and reattach automatically on the next launch. They're also reachable from any terminal with `tmux -L clave attach`. On by default when tmux is installed (sessions fall back to normal otherwise); you can turn it off in Settings → Sessions.

## [1.48.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- Claude Code session tabs now show their live status at a glance: the icon turns blue and pulses while Claude is **working**, an amber dot appears when Claude is **blocked** waiting for your input (a permission or selection prompt), and a green dot marks a session that **finished while you were away** — clearing as soon as you open the tab. Idle and freshly-started sessions stay clean. Status is driven by Claude Code's own lifecycle signals, so it's accurate rather than guessed. Gemini and Codex sessions stay neutral for now (see ROADMAP.md).

## [1.47.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- Screenshots dragged into a session straight from the macOS preview thumbnail are now copied into stable storage on drop, so the agent can still read them after macOS removes the original temporary file. Old copies are cleaned up automatically after 7 days.

## [1.47.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- New **Claude Agents** session type that launches `claude agents` instead of plain Claude Code — available from the New Session menu and with the **⌘⇧A** shortcut
- The three Claude session types are now distinguishable at a glance in the sidebar: a faint trailing glyph marks **Claude Agents** (bolt) and **skip-permissions** (shield) sessions, while plain **Claude Code** stays unmarked — the Claude logo itself is left clean

## [1.46.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Redesigned the remote agent conversation view: your messages now sit in a clean rounded bubble, the agent's replies flow as plain text for easier reading, and the whole thread is centered in a comfortable reading column
- New message composer with a rounded input and a circular send button that blends into the conversation background for a calmer, more focused look

## [1.45.1] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Remote sessions now show their provider's logo in the sidebar (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, or terminal) instead of a generic globe — the server-name badge already marks them as remote, so they now read just like local sessions
- The remote file tree now matches the local file tree's design — same row height, spacing, icons, and font size
- Refreshed the remote folder picker (shown when opening a session on a remote server) with a cleaner layout, Up and Home shortcuts, an editable breadcrumb path, keyboard navigation, and polished folder rows

### Fixed
- The remote server-name badge in the sidebar no longer crops longer names at a fixed width — it now grows to fit and truncates with an ellipsis, with the full name on hover

## [1.45.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Sidebar sessions now show their provider's actual logo — Claude Code, Gemini, and Codex sessions each display their brand mark instead of a generic icon. Claude sessions use the Claude logo whether or not permissions are skipped, and plain terminals keep the terminal icon

## [1.44.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- The **Settings** page is now centered for a more balanced layout that matches the rest of the app
- Polished the **Settings** page to match the rest of the app — consistent buttons, fonts, inputs, and list rows (the **Add Location** and **Add Workspace** buttons now look identical)

### Fixed
- The **Git** panel now names the parent repository when the folder you opened isn't itself a git repository, so it's clear why changes from outside that folder appear
- Opening the **Add Location** dialog now dims the whole window, including the **Git** panel, instead of leaving it bright

### Removed
- Removed the **App Icon** picker from Settings (only one icon was ever applied)
- Removed the **Launch Templates** feature — use `.clave` workspace files and session templates instead

## [1.43.1] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- The **Sessions** header's templates button now uses a tiles-with-plus icon instead of a folder-plus icon, so it reads as "launch from a template" rather than "add a folder"

## [1.43.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Files now open in a real code editor — syntax-highlighted **and** editable the moment they open, with no separate "Edit" step. Just click into the code, type, and press ⌘S to save. Highlighting now follows your theme (dark, light, and coffee), so code looks at home instead of washed out
- Markdown files open rendered, with a **Preview / Source** toggle to edit the raw text

### Changed
- The file preview panel and the file tab now share one editor, so they look and behave the same everywhere
- When a file is open in a tab, the path row shows a live save-status indicator — a **Save** button (with the ⌘S hint) while you have unsaved edits, and **Saved** once it's up to date — instead of a separate Save button above the file
- Closing the preview panel while you have unsaved edits now asks before discarding them, instead of silently dropping the changes

## [1.42.2] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Right-clicking an open file in the sidebar now shows icons next to **Copy Path** and **Reveal in Finder**, matching the other items in the menu and the rest of the app

## [1.42.1] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- The session templates grid no longer randomly reappears in the sidebar after dragging a file in and out — the file-drop target now reliably disappears once a drag ends

## [1.42.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- Session templates (your `.clave` workspaces) now open from a **folder-plus icon** next to the **Sessions** header, in a searchable popover — so having lots of templates no longer pushes your session list down the sidebar. Click a template to launch it; active ones stay highlighted. You can still drag a group or drop a `.clave` file onto the sidebar to pin a new one

### Changed
- The templates popover, the **New session** menu, and the user menu now open just to the right of the sidebar divider, and the Sessions header's action icon lines up with the row icons below it

## [1.41.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- The file action buttons in the preview panel (open in tab, open externally, edit, copy path, close) and every option in the file right-click menu now use the same Heroicons as the rest of the app, so the file panels look consistent with the session menus

### Fixed
- Right-click menus no longer get cropped near the screen edge — they now open leftward when close to the right edge and upward when close to the bottom

## [1.41.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Codex CLI** sessions — launch OpenAI's Codex CLI straight from the New session menu (or press Cmd+U), the same way you start Claude Code or Gemini CLI. Codex sessions get their own OpenAI mark in the menu and a chip-style icon in the sidebar, and they're remembered in pinned groups, templates, and `.clave` workspace files
- The file tree now shows distinct icons for more file types: spreadsheets and tables (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`), `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.json`, `.yml`/`.yaml`, `README.md`, and files with no extension each get their own icon instead of the generic document

### Changed
- The **New session** menu now opens to the right of the New session tab instead of dropping straight down, matching how the user menu in the sidebar footer opens

## [1.40.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- When you select a session, group, or file tab in the sidebar, the unselected rows now fade back so your active selection stands out by contrast. Dragging still takes visual priority over the fade
- The help docs now cover **Gemini CLI** sessions (Cmd+I) — the shortcut, the session type, and its star icon are documented alongside Claude Code, Terminal, and Dangerous mode

### Removed
- Dropped the stale **Cmd+F "Focus sidebar search"** entry from the shortcuts help — the sidebar search box was removed in 1.39.0, so the shortcut no longer exists

## [1.39.0] — 2026-05-25

### Changed
- The sidebar has been reorganized for a cleaner, more consistent layout. **New session** (now a pencil-square tab) and **Queue** sit at the top as permanent tabs, your sessions live under a single **Sessions** header, and pinned groups appear inline beneath it. Tab heights, row spacing, leading/trailing icon padding, and corner roundness are now driven by shared design tokens, so rows line up and the whole app feels a touch tighter and less round. Group and pinned cards align to the same width as normal tabs, and a selected tab inside a group no longer looks like it touches the card border
- The sidebar search box and the reset button were removed from the top of the sidebar

### Removed
- The **model-info pill** and the **context-inventory pill** in the terminal header have been removed. These started as a community contribution, and we're grateful for it — the removal is not a judgment on the work. Claude Code now reports the same information natively in its own statusline (active model, reasoning effort, thinking, context-window size and the live context-fill percentage), so the pills duplicated what CC already shows. The context-inventory pill in particular could mislead: it estimated a static footprint of your config files against a guessed context window (often 200k even on 1M-context models), whereas CC's statusline reports true live usage against the real window. To let CC's native statusline show through, Clave no longer injects its own `statusLine` hook into sessions — your configured statusline (or CC's default) now appears directly, unmodified
- The **Daily Log** sidebar widget (the per-project session journal with daily/AI summaries) has been removed, along with its Settings toggles and the background session-summarization it ran. It watched every session lifecycle change and summarized completed sessions, costing CPU for a feature that did not work reliably. The matching Settings options and help docs are gone too
- The **History** sidebar section and panel (browse/search past Claude Code conversations) has been removed, along with the underlying transcript reader and IPC. It overlapped with browsing your sessions directly, and the conversation transcripts remain on disk under `~/.claude` for any external tooling that wants them

## [1.38.1] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Gemini CLI session tabs now use a clean star icon that matches the other tab icons, instead of the previous heavy custom glyph that looked out of place and garbled at small sizes

## [1.38.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- The Git panel now shows a **Publish Branch** button when you're on a branch that has no upstream — committing on a new local branch used to look silent because the Push button only appeared when `ahead > 0` relative to a remote, which an unpublished branch never has. The Publish Branch button replaces Push in that state, shows the unpublished commit count, and runs `git push -u origin <branch>` so the branch is tracked from then on

## [1.37.3] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- Claude Code's welcome banner now renders at full width when you spawn a session, instead of appearing as a mangled sliver. The PTY used to be born at a fixed 80×24, so the welcome banner was laid out for 80 columns and then garbled when xterm reflowed to your actual terminal width. The PTY now waits until the terminal has measured itself before starting Claude, so the banner is laid out for the real width from the start
- Your custom `statusLine` from `~/.claude/settings.json` is now preserved inside Clave sessions — Clave's own status hook used to override it entirely, hiding the context-fill bar and any other bottom-bar metadata you'd configured. Clave now chains the user's statusLine command through its hook so both Clave's pills and your own bottom-bar appear
- The bash interactive prompt, macOS "default shell is now zsh" notice, and the echoed `claude …` command no longer flash on screen at session start — Claude is now exec'd directly by a non-interactive shell

## [1.37.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Terminal text no longer gets duplicated, truncated, or mojibaked when you toggle the sidebar / file tree or view sessions side-by-side — Framer Motion's panel animation used to fire dozens of SIGWINCH signals to the PTY during a single resize, causing Claude Code to repaint the conversation into the scrollback over and over. The PTY now receives exactly one resize at the settled size, so the conversation stays readable and scrollback isn't bloated with duplicates

## [1.37.1] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- Cmd+Z in the sidebar now undoes the last group/move/rename/recolor action — accidentally disbanding a group or dragging a session into the wrong place is no longer permanent

## [1.37.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- Windows installer is now built and attached to every GitHub Release automatically — Windows users can download a `.exe` setup alongside the macOS `.dmg`/`.zip`

## [1.36.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Model / effort / context pills now appear in the packaged app — the statusLine hook script was looked up at the wrong path inside the bundle, so the hook never registered and the pills stayed empty (they only worked in `npm run dev`)

## [1.36.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- Model pill in the terminal header surfaces the active Claude Code model (e.g. "Opus 4.7") at a glance — click it to open a popover with the full session config: raw model id, reasoning effort, thinking on/off, fast mode, context window size, output style, agent, and live session cost
- All values stay live via Claude Code's documented `statusLine` hook, so running `/model`, `/effort`, or `/fast` inside the session updates the pill on the next status refresh

### Fixed
- Context Inventory now reports usage against the real 1M context window on extended-context sessions instead of clipping at 200k

## [1.35.7] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- File tree no longer collapses all open folders when you switch to the Git tab and back — expansion and filter state now survive the round-trip
- Terminal no longer gets left in a cramped or mis-sized state when opening or closing the file tree, git panel, or sidebar — the final fit now waits for the panel animation to settle and refreshes the viewport to clear any leftover glyphs

## [1.35.6] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Save discussion now finds the right transcript even after `/clear`, `/compact`, or `/resume` rotates Claude's session UUID — it falls back to matching by the session id recorded inside the JSONL, then to the most recently modified JSONL in the project folder
- Save discussion and Save plan now show a clear error dialog when the transcript can't be found, instead of silently doing nothing
- Save discussion and Save plan now work for remote Claude sessions — the transcript is fetched from the remote host over SFTP instead of being looked up only on the local disk

## [1.35.5] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- Multi-repo git panel: hovering a repo name for ~2 seconds reveals a tooltip with the shortened full path, making it easy to tell apart repos with the same name

## [1.35.4] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Generate commit message now retries once on transient failures and falls back to Sonnet when Haiku is overloaded, so the "Command failed" error that appeared ~50% of the time should be much rarer
- Commit message generator now surfaces the real underlying error (including stderr) when the Claude CLI fails, instead of a truncated generic message
- Bumped the commit message generation timeout from 30s to 60s to cover slower Haiku responses

## [1.35.1] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Generate commit message no longer fails when changes are already staged — previously it tried to re-stage all files including already-staged ones, causing pathspec errors on renamed or moved files

## [1.35.0] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Context Inventory popover no longer flashes to the top-left corner when you open a new session (Cmd+T / Cmd+D) with the popover open — it now vanishes cleanly as the session hides

## [1.34.3] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Context Inventory popover no longer closes when you click inside it (e.g. expanding Skills or Agents) — removed an over-eager window-blur handler that was firing on focus transitions between the terminal and the popover

## [1.34.2] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Context Inventory no longer shows the same plugin, skill, or command multiple times — it now reads the active install list from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` instead of walking every cached version on disk, and honours `enabledPlugins` plus local-scope `projectPath` so only plugins Claude Code would actually load for the current session are counted

## [1.34.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Context Inventory popover no longer drifts to the top-left of the screen when switching sessions or opening a new Clave window — it now closes automatically when its session is hidden or the window loses focus
- Close (×) button on the Context Inventory popover now reliably dismisses it

## [1.34.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Context Inventory popover** per session — click the database icon in the terminal header to see what Claude Code loads at session start (CLAUDE.md chain, skills, plugins, commands, agents, MCP servers, hooks, project memory) with estimated token cost and percentage of the context window
- Always-on percentage badge next to the inventory icon so you can see your context fill at a glance without opening the popover (subtle under 40%, amber at 40–70%, red at 70%+)
- Stacked category bar and colored legend at the top of the popover, making it instantly obvious which bucket is dominating your context
- Per-row proportional fill bars inside each category so the heaviest entries stand out without having to read numbers
- Info tooltip in the popover with quick tips for reducing context (`/plugin`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `~/.claude/settings.json`)
- In-app help page (Help → "Context Inventory") explaining what's measured, what isn't (e.g. MCP runtime tool schemas), and the read-only design philosophy
- Addresses [issue #9](https://github.com/codika-io/clave/issues/9)

## [1.33.0] — 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Daily Log redesigned for at-a-glance readability: 7-day week strip with heatmap intensity, stat cards for time/sessions/projects, and a timeline view of entries coloured by project
- Entry cards get a unified card layout with clearer hierarchy — project chip, entry name, time range, and parsed summary with bullets
- New Timeline / By project toggle lets you switch between a flat chronological feed and the project-grouped view

## [1.32.6] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Open git diffs as document tabs from the git panel — "Open as tab" button in the diff preview header, and a right-click "Open as tab" option on any changed file in the git tree
- Diff tabs live-update on stage/unstage and git refresh, and keep Stage/Unstage actions inline
- Same file can coexist as multiple tabs: file content, unstaged diff, staged diff, and per-commit diff

## [1.32.5] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Announcements container (What's New / Update banners) no longer adds bottom padding when empty

- Week and Month views show daily cost with navigation between periods
- Hover reveals exact cost per bar with smooth fade animation

### Changed
- Usage data now computes accurate daily cost from per-category token breakdowns (input, output, cache read, cache creation) instead of a single total
- Model breakdown component is now full-width

## [1.32.3] — 2026-04-10

### Changed

## [1.32.1] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Light theme refreshed with Linear-inspired warm grays instead of pure neutral grays
- Accent color updated from bright blue to Linear's indigo-violet (#5e6ad2)
- Color palette (profile avatars and group colors) replaced with muted, desaturated tones matching Linear's aesthetic

## [1.32.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Work tracker redesigned: merged into unified sidebar footer section as a single clickable line instead of a floating card
- Clicking the work tracker now navigates directly to the full Usage page
- Time tracking now shows wall-clock time instead of summing concurrent sessions independently

### Fixed
- Work tracker could show impossible values like "18 hours yesterday" due to a heuristic that multiplied message counts by 2 minutes
- Concurrent sessions inflated today's total (3 sessions for 1 hour showed 3h instead of 1h)

### Removed
- Yesterday summary, weekly chart, and token costs from the work tracker widget (available in the Usage page instead)

## [1.31.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- Design system: semantic CSS tokens for sidebar items, buttons, inputs, badges, and icon buttons in main.css
- History conversation view: chat bubble layout with user messages right-aligned and assistant messages left-aligned

- All buttons, inputs, badges, and icon buttons across 35 components now use shared design tokens
- Border radius standardized (icon buttons use rounded-md, dialogs use rounded-xl)
- Dialog footer buttons unified with btn-dialog class
- What's New banner relocated to sidebar

### Fixed
- Inconsistent spacing between sidebar items (session tabs vs activity tabs)
- Arbitrary shadow values replaced with design system tokens
- AddLocationDialog used rounded-2xl instead of rounded-xl like other dialogs
